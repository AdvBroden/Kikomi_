-- To Activate Kikomi you must Create a Local Script inside of StarterPlayer > StarterCharacterScripts

local ServerScriptS = game:GetService("ServerScriptService")
local K_MV = ServerScriptS:WaitForChild("Kikomi_"):WaitForChild("Version")
print(K_MV.Value)

-- For Modders, Enable the Value; "Modded".

--[[
    
  --// Explaination on the 'Modded' Boolvalue //--
  
  Modded Values will Disable all Scripts containing Traces of The Antivirus'. The Antivirus is used to
  prevent hackers from Changing the Script's Codes or Animations. The Antivirus will Primarily Attempt
  to check if the AnimationId's have been Set to an Unknown Substatute, When Said Code is Changed, 
  Kikomi will Automatically Destroy itself with a print in output, 'Antivirus Detected Problem'. 
  Please note that the Antivirus will not be activated and Kikomi is now vulnerable to Hackers or 
  In-game Virus'.
  
  The Antivirus being Disabled allows the Script to enable changes from the Code without Kikomi using it's
  Virus Detection Sequence.
  
  --// Troubleshooting //--
  
  1. If the Version value is matched to the GithubVersion then You may continue to run the script.
     If not then you must reinstall the Latest Version of Kikomi Into your Game to Ensure there
     are not any current errors in the Script.
     
  2. If the Version is Matched to the GithubVersion and No Inputs are Coming into the Output Menu
     Check if the Script is Active. Check in Kikomi > Settings > Enabled, If the value is set to false
     then Change the Value to True
     
  3. If You are modding Kikomi, Then Read Over your Scripts for Errors or Check in the Output Menu
     For Any Mispelled Lines of Code or Errors in said Code.
